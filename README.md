Libplanfahr is a GObject based library to query public transport inforation. It
(in principle) supports different providers although at the moment only one is
implemented. It features GObject introspection so you can use it from languages
like JavaScript and Python. 

The API is by no means stable yet.

It depends on glib, libsoup, libxml2, gnome-common and gtk-doc-tools:

    apt-get install libsoup2.4-dev libglib2.0-dev libxml2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev \
                    gnome-common gtk-doc-tools

To build from source use:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
     make

To install use

    make install

To run from the compiled source code use

    ./run <program>

for example

    ./run python3 examples/trip-query.py Gelsenkirchen Essen
